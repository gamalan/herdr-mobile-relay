# Herdr Mobile Relay

[![check](https://github.com/0cv/herdr-mobile-relay/actions/workflows/check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/0cv/herdr-mobile-relay/actions/workflows/check.yml)

A remote control for [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) agents on Linux and macOS: use your smartphone to monitor status, answer prompts, build plans, and manage their lifecycle.

**Current version:** `0.6.0`

Each computer runs its own local relay. The phone app connects to those relays directly and merges their agents; there is no central broker and the computers do not connect to each other.

## Quick Start

Requirements: Herdr 0.7.0 or newer, Git, and `curl`.

```bash
herdr plugin install 0cv/herdr-mobile-relay
```

The setup menu normally opens after installation. If it does not, run:

```bash
herdr plugin action invoke setup --plugin herdr-mobile-relay.events
```

Choose **Quick Start**. It installs missing user-level tools with confirmation, starts the relay and phone app, then opens a temporary TryCloudflare tunnel. No Cloudflare account, domain, Python installation, Node.js, or separate web deployment is required.

Scan the printed QR code or open its complete HTTPS setup link on your phone. Keep the setup pane open; Ctrl-C stops both the relay and the temporary tunnel. A later Quick Start gets a new hostname, so use its new setup link.

The setup link contains the relay token in its URL fragment. The fragment is not sent to the server and is removed after import, but the link and QR code must still be kept private.

See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for the short walkthrough and troubleshooting.

## Stable Everyday Setup

Quick tunnels are disposable. For a permanent hostname and a background service, first add a domain to a Cloudflare account. Then open the setup menu and choose **Stable Tunnel**, or run:

```bash
herdr plugin action invoke install-service --plugin herdr-mobile-relay.events
```

The stable wizard:

1. Logs in to Cloudflare when needed.
2. Lets you confirm the dedicated tunnel and `relay-<computer>.<domain>` hostname.
3. Creates or resumes the tunnel and DNS route without overwriting an existing record.
4. Installs a launchd service on macOS or a user-systemd service on Linux.
5. Verifies public DNS, HTTPS, and the relay identity before printing the stable QR code.

If setup is interrupted or times out, run the exact command it prints. Its private state is resumable and prevents duplicate tunnels.

Run the wizard separately on every computer, with a distinct hostname for each relay. Add every setup link to the same phone app; the app merges them locally.

Useful plugin actions:

```bash
herdr plugin action invoke status --plugin herdr-mobile-relay.events
herdr plugin action invoke stable-teardown --plugin herdr-mobile-relay.events
```

Teardown is explicit and confirmed. It removes only resources recorded as owned by the wizard. Run it before uninstalling the plugin if you also want the Cloudflare resources removed.

> [!NOTE]
> `make stable-setup` and `make setup-link` are checkout-development commands. Do not use a checkout's `make setup-link` for a marketplace installation whose service uses the plugin configuration; the command intentionally refuses that configuration mismatch.

## What You Can Do

- Merge agents from several computers into one mobile view.
- Approve ordinary permission prompts and answer Claude Code or Codex structured questions.
- View terminal output and send prompts, slash commands with suggestions, terminal keys, screenshots, or photos.
- Start, rename, clear, and stop detected Codex, Claude Code, and OpenCode agents.
- Search relay activity and receive blocked-agent or optional completion notifications.
- Require device verification before reconnecting relays.
- Install the app as a PWA on Android or iOS.

## Phone Setup

The QR code adds the relay URL, label, and token automatically. To add one manually, open **Settings** and enter:

- **Relay Name:** a label such as `Mac` or `Fedora`
- **Relay URL:** the relay's `wss://` URL
- **Token:** its `HERDR_RELAY_TOKEN`

Enable notifications from Settings. Blocked-agent notifications are included while push is enabled; completion notifications are optional per device.

To install the PWA, open the HTTPS app in Safari and use **Share → Add to Home Screen**, or use Chrome's **Install app** action. A temporary TryCloudflare hostname is unsuitable for a permanent installation because it changes when restarted.

## How It Works

- The Python relay listens on `127.0.0.1:8375`, serves the committed app in `web/`, and accepts authenticated WebSocket connections.
- Cloudflare Tunnel provides the public HTTPS/WSS endpoint without opening an inbound port.
- The Svelte source lives in `frontend/`; phone relay configuration stays in browser local storage.
- The Herdr plugin sends local status-change events to UDP port `8376` so blocked and finished states arrive promptly.
- Runtime data remains local: push state, bounded activity, Claude history, and temporary uploads are kept in the relay's private config or cache directories.

The relay never SSHs into another computer. Each relay invokes only fixed local Herdr operations and exposes only detected supported agent profiles.

## Agent Profiles Configuration

By default the relay detects Codex, Claude Code, and OpenCode. Additional agents (e.g. Pi) can be added with an INI file at `~/.config/herdr/agent-profiles.ini` (respects `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`).

```ini
[profiles]
codex = Codex
claude = Claude Code
opencode = OpenCode
pi = Pi
```

- Keys in `[profiles]` are **merged** with the built-in defaults. You only need to add new agents or override existing labels.
- Set `[config] replace_profiles = true` to replace instead of merge.
- Each profile's binary must be on `PATH` for the relay to advertise it. Missing binaries print a warning.

### Custom Slash-Command Suggestions

For agents other than Claude Code and Codex, the relay discovers slash-command suggestions from skill directories. Add a `[skills]` section to configure per-agent paths:

```ini
[skills]
pi = ~/.pi/agent/skills
```

- Keys match profile ids from `[profiles]`. Directories are scanned for `*/SKILL.md` frontmatter (`name`, `description`, optional `argument-hint`).
- The first configured path is labelled **personal**; subsequent paths are **project**.
- Paths are `:`-separated on macOS and Linux (``os.pathsep``). Directory names containing `:` are not supported.
- Pi skills emit `/skill:<name>` (Pi's native syntax). Other agents use `/<name>`.
- `user-invocable: false` in frontmatter hides a skill from suggestions.

### Hot Reload

Send `SIGHUP` to the relay process to re-read `agent-profiles.ini` without restarting. New client connections pick up the updated profiles; existing connections keep their already-received catalog. On the phone, the slash‑command cache is per agent + working directory, so switching directories fetches fresh suggestions.

## Security

- Treat setup links, QR codes, relay URLs, and tokens as secrets.
- Public WebSocket control requires the relay token; comparisons are constant-time.
- The relay binds to loopback by default and refuses an unauthenticated non-loopback bind.
- Browser origins are checked, uploaded images are limited to 10 MB, and launch requests cannot supply arbitrary executables or shell commands.
- A connected phone can control the Herdr panes exposed by that relay. Remove an unknown relay from Settings and rotate a leaked token immediately.

Rotate a checkout token with `make rotate-token`. To rotate a marketplace installation from a checkout, select its configuration explicitly:

```bash
HERDR_RELAY_ENV="$(herdr plugin config-dir herdr-mobile-relay.events)/relay.env" make rotate-token
```

## Local Checkout

Use a checkout for development or for running without the marketplace plugin:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0cv/herdr-mobile-relay.git
cd herdr-mobile-relay
make quick-start
```

The checkout stores relay configuration in `relay/.env`.

```bash
make dev-tunnel        # build frontend/dist, then use isolated ports and a temporary tunnel
make stable-setup       # provision/resume a named tunnel and service
make service-status    # inspect the installed service
make service-logs      # follow service logs
make stable-teardown   # remove wizard-owned stable resources
```

If you intentionally manage Cloudflare yourself, set `CLOUDFLARED_CONFIG` in the active relay environment before installing the service. The stable wizard validates and reuses a compatible existing configuration without rewriting it.

`make dev-tunnel` requires Node.js 24, keeps its token and push state under ignored `relay/.dev/`, and never reads the production relay configuration. Keep it in the foreground and press Ctrl-C to stop both the relay and tunnel.

## Development

Backend checks use Python 3.10 or newer. Frontend development is pinned to Node.js 24.

```bash
make backend-check
npm ci --prefix frontend
make frontend-check
make frontend-browser
make check
```

On Fedora, do not use `playwright install-deps`; it attempts to run Ubuntu's `apt-get`. `make frontend-browser` runs Chromium locally and WebKit in Playwright's pinned Podman container.

Normal frontend work builds untracked `frontend/dist/`. Release work alone replaces the committed `web/` bundle:

```bash
make web-release
make web-release-check
```

`make web-deploy` deploys the already committed bundle and never rebuilds it. See [Web Release and Rollback](docs/WEB_RELEASE.md) for staging, cutover, and recovery.

## Troubleshooting

- **No setup menu:** invoke the `setup` plugin action shown above.
- **Port 8375 is busy:** stop the earlier quick start or installed service before starting another relay.
- **Temporary link does not open:** keep the Quick Start pane open and rerun it if `cloudflared` exited; every run creates a new hostname.
- **App opens but does not connect:** reopen the complete setup link, including its `#setup=...` fragment.
- **Stable setup stops:** preserve its state and rerun the exact command printed in the error.
- **Stable hostname already exists:** choose another hostname or remove the unrelated DNS record yourself; the wizard never overwrites it.
- **Need a support snapshot:** run the plugin `status` action.

`GET /health` returns `ok`. `GET /healthz` returns the relay instance, version, and protocol used by the stable wizard and Settings diagnostics.

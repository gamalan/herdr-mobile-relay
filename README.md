# Herdr Mobile Relay

Approve [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) agents from your phone across multiple computers.

Herdr Mobile Relay runs a small local relay on each computer, exposes each relay through its own Cloudflare Tunnel hostname, and lets one static web app connect to all of them. The phone UI merges agents from every configured relay, so you can approve or inspect agents running on a Mac, a Fedora workstation, or any other supported machine without making those computers connect to each other.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Herdr Mobile Relay currently supports only Linux and macOS. Windows is not supported.

## Attribution

This project is forked from and inspired by [dcolinmorgan/herdr-remote](https://github.com/dcolinmorgan/herdr-remote). Herdr Mobile Relay keeps the original idea of approving Herdr agents remotely, but has been substantially reworked around a static phone web app, per-computer local relays, Cloudflare Tunnel hostnames, and no SSH or Telegram fan-out.

## What This Fork Adds

The upstream project established the core idea: control Herdr approval prompts from another device. This fork turns that idea into an installable mobile web app for multiple machines, with no central broker and no machine-to-machine trust.

- **Multi-computer phone UI:** one static web app connects to multiple independent relays and merges Mac, Fedora, or other hosts into one agent list.
- **Per-machine isolation:** each computer runs only its own local relay and `herdr` CLI calls; relays do not SSH into each other or share state.
- **PWA notifications:** installed phones can receive Web Push notifications when an agent blocks, including Approve once and Deny actions that route through the configured relay and device unlock.
- **Mobile terminal composer:** terminal view has a compact phone-first composer, quick terminal keys, inline approval actions, themes, font sizing, and a jump-to-bottom affordance.
- **Real approval handling:** blocked cards parse prompt text and approval options, then map visible choices back to the correct Herdr key actions for Codex and Claude Code.
- **Confirmed controls and activity:** command acknowledgements report failures explicitly, approvals wait for an observed state change, and a bounded per-relay activity history is merged on the phone.
- **Remote agent management:** start automatically detected installed agents, then rename, clear, or stop them from the phone.
- **Screenshot/photo upload:** attach an image from the phone, store it on the target computer, and insert the local path into the agent prompt.
- **Optional device unlock:** require the phone's platform authenticator before reconnecting relays after open, reload, or resume.
- **Service installers:** macOS launchd and Linux/Fedora user systemd installers set up the relay, tunnel, token, and cleanup of older service names.
- **Security hardening:** token generation, loopback binding by default, Origin checks for browser clients, constant-time token comparison, and safer behavior for public tunnels.

## Marketplace Listing

**Name:** Herdr Mobile Relay

**Repository slug:** `herdr-mobile-relay`

**Plugin ID:** `herdr-mobile-relay.events`

**Short description:** Approve Herdr agents from your phone across multiple computers.

**Long description:** Run one local relay per computer, expose each relay through Cloudflare Tunnel, and manage all agents from one installable mobile web app. Herdr Mobile Relay keeps machines independent: there is no SSH fan-out, central broker, Telegram bot, or native mobile app to install. It adds multi-relay agent merging, actionable Web Push notifications, confirmed terminal and approval controls, remote agent lifecycle management, merged activity history, screenshot/photo upload, optional device unlock, and service installers for macOS and Linux.

**Tags:** mobile, relay, cloudflare, multi-machine, approvals

## What It Does

- Runs one local relay per computer.
- Polls only the local `herdr` CLI on that computer.
- Exposes the relay through a `wss://` URL, usually via Cloudflare Tunnel.
- Lets the static web app connect to multiple relays and merge their agent lists client-side.
- Uses relay labels from the web app, such as `Mac` or `Fedora`, as the visible host badges.
- Shows blocked prompts with inline approval buttons on the agent list and in the terminal view.
- Sends Web Push notifications for blocked agents to installed phones, even when the app is closed or suspended.
- Routes notification taps and Approve once/Deny actions back to the matching relay and pane when the app can resolve it.
- Confirms remote commands and records blocked, resolved, approval, prompt, upload, and lifecycle activity locally on each relay.
- Starts automatically detected installed agents and supports rename, clear, and stop controls.
- Uploads screenshots and photos from the phone to the connected relay's local filesystem.
- Provides a compact mobile terminal UI with send, attach, terminal keys, themes, and font-size controls.
- Can require fingerprint, face unlock, or passcode verification before reconnecting relays.
- Supports an optional local Herdr plugin hook for faster blocked-agent updates.

## What It Does Not Do

- It does not connect your computers to each other.
- It does not use SSH remotes or SSH fan-out.
- It does not run a central hosted broker.
- It does not require Telegram, a native iOS app, or a native macOS menu bar app.
- It does not currently run on Windows.

## Components

- **Relay:** Python WebSocket service with an HTTP health response on port `8375`.
- **Web app:** static mobile UI in `web/`; stores relay configs in browser local storage.
- **Cloudflare Tunnel:** optional but recommended public access layer for each relay.
- **Background services:** launchd on macOS and user systemd on Linux/Fedora start the relay and `cloudflared`.
- **Herdr plugin hook:** optional local event push from `herdr` into the local relay over UDP.

## Requirements

- Linux or macOS; Windows is not currently supported
- Git and Make
- Python 3.10+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) 0.7+
- `cloudflared` for phone access through a tunnel
- Node.js/npm for the included Cloudflare Pages deployment command and JavaScript checks

## Quick Start

Clone the repository, prepare the local configuration, and check prerequisites:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0cv/herdr-mobile-relay.git
cd herdr-mobile-relay
make setup
```

Deploy the static phone app once. `make setup` creates `.env` with the default Pages project name; edit `WEB_PROJECT` there first if needed.

```bash
make web-deploy
```

Then start a temporary relay and Cloudflare quick tunnel:

```bash
make quick-start
```

The script prints:

```text
Tunnel URL: https://example.trycloudflare.com
WebSocket:  wss://example.trycloudflare.com
Token:      0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
```

Open your deployed web app on your phone and add both the `wss://...trycloudflare.com` URL and token in Settings. Quick tunnels are temporary; the hostname changes when the tunnel restarts. The generated token is stored in `relay/.env` and reused on later runs.

If you already have a hosted copy of `web/`, skip `make web-deploy`. See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for the condensed flow.

## Web App

The web app is static and lives in `web/`.

Deploy it anywhere that can host static files over HTTPS. With Cloudflare Pages direct upload:

```bash
# make setup creates .env; edit WEB_PROJECT there if needed
make web-deploy
```

### Install on Your Phone

Install the deployed web app URL, not a `wss://` relay URL. The installed app keeps your relay settings in browser local storage.

On iPhone or iPad:

1. Open the deployed Herdr Mobile Relay web app in Safari.
2. Tap Share.
3. Tap Add to Home Screen.
4. Tap Add.

On Android:

1. Open the deployed Herdr Mobile Relay web app in Chrome.
2. Tap the install prompt, or open the three-dot menu.
3. Tap Install app or Add to Home screen.
4. Confirm the install.

The app includes a web manifest and Apple touch icon, so it installs with the Herdr Relay icon.

In the app Settings, add one relay entry per computer:

- **Relay Name:** display label such as `Mac` or `Fedora`
- **Relay URL:** `wss://...`
- **Token:** value of `HERDR_RELAY_TOKEN`

Then tap **Enable Notifications** in Settings. The relay generates Web Push VAPID keys in `relay/push/` and stores this device's push subscription there, so installed PWAs can be notified even when the app is closed or suspended.

For multiple relays, the app creates one scoped service-worker push subscription per relay. Each relay keeps its standard VAPID keypair and subscriptions privately under `relay/push/`; no push configuration is required.

In the terminal view, tap the image icon to attach a screenshot or photo. The web app uploads images up to 10 MB to `~/.cache/herdr-mobile-relay/uploads` on that computer and inserts the local file path into the prompt.

Use **＋** in the app header to start an agent on a connected computer. The relay exposes detected `codex`, `claude`, and `opencode` executables as safe launch profiles. Select a working directory reported by that relay; the suggested name updates to `<directory>-<agent>`. The optional initial task is sent as the agent's first literal prompt after Herdr creates it and is never interpreted by a shell. Each launched agent is moved into its own named tab so it cannot inherit another agent's tab label. Use **•••** from a terminal to rename, clear, or stop that agent. Clear starts a fresh replacement with the same detected profile and working directory, moves it to a dedicated tab, and then closes the old pane.

Use **◷** to view and search the merged activity history from all connected relays. Each relay keeps the latest 500 entries in `~/.cache/herdr-mobile-relay/activity.jsonl`. Prompt activity stores only a short preview, not full terminal output.

The relay automatically exposes installed Codex, Claude Code, and OpenCode executables in the Start Agent form. Its working-directory browser starts at the relay user's home directory and retrieves only the current folder's immediate non-hidden subdirectories as you navigate. It does not recursively scan or preload the filesystem. There is no profile configuration, and the browser cannot submit an executable or arbitrary shell command. Navigation and agent launches stay inside the current user's home directory.

## Stable Hostnames

For day-to-day use, create one named Cloudflare Tunnel and one DNS hostname per computer:

```bash
# On the Mac
cloudflared tunnel login
cloudflared tunnel create herdr-mobile-relay-mac
cloudflared tunnel route dns herdr-mobile-relay-mac relay-mac.yourdomain.com

# On Fedora
cloudflared tunnel create herdr-mobile-relay-fedora
cloudflared tunnel route dns herdr-mobile-relay-fedora relay-fedora.yourdomain.com
```

Create `~/.cloudflared/config-herdr-mobile-relay.yml` on each computer. Example for the Mac:

```yaml
tunnel: herdr-mobile-relay-mac
credentials-file: /Users/you/.cloudflared/<TUNNEL_ID>.json

ingress:
  - hostname: relay-mac.yourdomain.com
    service: http://localhost:8375
  - service: http_status:404
```

For Fedora:

```yaml
tunnel: herdr-mobile-relay-fedora
credentials-file: /home/you/.cloudflared/<TUNNEL_ID>.json

ingress:
  - hostname: relay-fedora.yourdomain.com
    service: http://localhost:8375
  - service: http_status:404
```

Use both relay URLs in the web app:

```text
wss://relay-mac.yourdomain.com
wss://relay-fedora.yourdomain.com
```

Do not run multiple computers as replicas of the same Cloudflare Tunnel if they serve different local relays. Cloudflare may send a WebSocket to any connector for that tunnel.

## Background Services

The background service starts both the relay and `cloudflared`. The generic commands detect macOS or Linux automatically:

```bash
make service-install
make service-status
make service-logs
make service-uninstall
```

The older `make macos-service-*` and `make linux-service-*` targets remain available for explicit platform-specific use.

Normal installs need only two values in `relay/.env`. `make setup` generates the token, and the stable service installer adds the tunnel path:

```env
HERDR_RELAY_TOKEN=<shared-secret>
CLOUDFLARED_CONFIG=$HOME/.cloudflared/config-herdr-mobile-relay.yml
```

Read the token for the web app:

```bash
sed -n 's/^HERDR_RELAY_TOKEN=//p' relay/.env
```

New installs use `com.herdr-mobile-relay.service` on macOS and `herdr-mobile-relay.service` on Linux/Fedora. The installers remove the earlier `herdr-remote` service labels when they run. Existing ignored `relay/.env` files may still point at `config-herdr-remote.yml`; that is fine as long as the file exists, or you can update `CLOUDFLARED_CONFIG` to the new `config-herdr-mobile-relay.yml` path.

## Token Auth

Enable relay auth with:

```bash
export HERDR_RELAY_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 16)"
make relay-run
```

Use the same `HERDR_RELAY_TOKEN` on multiple relays if you want one shared phone-side secret.

## Herdr Plugin Hook

The relay polls local `herdr` every few seconds. For faster blocked-agent updates, link the local plugin hook on each computer:

```bash
make relay-plugin
```

The plugin sends local agent-status events to the local relay over UDP on `127.0.0.1:8376`. It does not expose another network service and does not connect to other computers.

## Security Model

- Relay access is protected with `HERDR_RELAY_TOKEN` for quick-start and service installs.
- Cloudflare Tunnel provides the public TLS endpoint; the relay itself listens locally on `127.0.0.1:8375` by default.
- Set `HERDR_RELAY_HOST` only if you intentionally need a non-loopback bind address. The relay refuses a non-loopback bind without `HERDR_RELAY_TOKEN`.
- Tokenless browser connections are rejected unless their `Origin` is listed in `HERDR_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` as a comma-separated list, such as `https://your-pages-site.pages.dev`.
- The web app stores relay URLs and tokens in browser local storage on the device where you configure it.
- Web Push VAPID private keys and push subscriptions are local runtime state in `relay/push/`; keep that directory private and do not commit it.
- A connected web client can send text and key input to Herdr panes exposed by that relay. Treat relay URLs and tokens as sensitive.
- Notification action payloads contain only relay/pane routing metadata. The PWA reconnects with its locally stored relay credential and performs device verification when enabled before sending the action.
- Agent launch requests select only from supported executables automatically found by the relay; the browser cannot submit an executable or shell command.
- The relay executes only fixed local `herdr pane ...` and supported `herdr agent ...` operations; it does not shell into other machines.
